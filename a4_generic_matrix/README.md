# Au664287 - Kasper Moller

This should be able to run by using the build.sh if ninja is installed or if it
is already built, by using run.sh

 ```
./build.sh
 ```

or 
 ```
./run.sh
 ```

The compiled file is placed in the /bin

I set everything up with cmakelist. This time I tried with the headerfiles
instead of modules.
